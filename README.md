<h4>We’ve developed an innovative system to revolutionize the selection process for Shark Tank India Season 4.

2. Administration that how much the company spends on administration.<br> 
3. Marketing Spend that how much the company spends on marketing.<br> 
4. Profit that is the company generating<br> 
<h3>Model Selection:</h3>
- We have to train a multiple linear regression model to predict the profit that a company will make based on how much they spend on R & D, Administration and Marketing.<br>
- By analyzing the profit we will decide which company we should invest into and call on Shark Tank Season 4.
<h3>Visualize the result to check accuracy:</h3>To evaluate the accuracy of our model, we will create a scatter plot comparing the actual values (y_test) and the predicted values (y_pred). This visualization allows us to observe how closely the predicted values align with the actual values, providing insights into the model's performance and reliability.
